  content: '<p>I\'ve been diving deep into the Mandela Effect phenomenon and it\'s blowing my mind. How can so many people remember things differently? The Berenstain Bears vs Berenstein Bears is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Some theories suggest we\'re shifting between parallel universes where small details change. Others think it\'s just collective false memory. What do you all think?</p><p>Here are some other examples I\'ve found:</p><ul><li>Darth Vader never actually says "Luke, I am your father"</li><li>The Monopoly man doesn\'t have a monocle (but so many remember him with one!)</li><li>Pikachu\'s tail - was the tip always black or not?</li></ul>',

  content: '<p>I know how this sounds, but I need to share what happened last night. I was working late in my office building (23rd floor) when I went to the bathroom around 2am.</p><p>When I came out, the hallway was... different. The lights were flickering and the carpet was this ugly yellow pattern I\'d never seen before. The air smelled stale, like an old hotel.</p><p>I walked toward where the elevators should be but the hallway just kept going. No doors, no exits, just this endless yellow hallway with buzzing fluorescent lights.</p><p>After what felt like 20 minutes of walking (but my phone showed only 3 minutes had passed), I turned a corner and suddenly I was back in the normal office. Has anyone else experienced something like this?</p>',
